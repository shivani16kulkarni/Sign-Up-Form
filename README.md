## Sign-Up-Form

This is a sign-up form designed for people who want to join a warm and friendly book club. The form is part of a fictional club called *The Paw & Page Society*, where reading and pets go hand in hand. It is built using only HTML and CSS, with a focus on simple layout and clear structure.

## About the Project

This project was created as a front-end practice exercise. The goal was to design a form that is easy to use, looks welcoming, and fits the cozy theme of the book club. No JavaScript, frameworks, or backend features are used.

Note: This is a demo form. It does not collect or store any real user data.
